# RGS2

This should help coding client-side [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) scripts faster. will it really do it? probably not.

## Injecting
```lua
local Modules = loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBuildGamesSometimes/RGS2/main/Main.lua'))()
Modules.Start({"Sound"}) -- A table of the Modules you are going to use.

Modules.Sound.Play("Start") -- An example of the "Sound" module, this will play the "Start" sound.
```
Full list of modules can viewed [here](https://github.com/IBuildGamesSometimes/RGS2/tree/main/Modules).

## Supporting
``Synapse X``

###### WIP - I started working on this at 1/1/2023, I'll probably give up after a day. maybe two.
